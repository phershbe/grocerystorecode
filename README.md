**About This Project**

This project was made by me to use for my programming portfolio.

It uses React to showcase my quickly developing talents in the area. An aspect of this that is more complicated than my previous project, the Doggo Wishlist, is that I have begun to break things into components here. Here I created an extra component called "Item" in order to create the structure for each item I would offering in the grocery store. This child component includes onClick functions which I passed up to the parent component through callbacks in the parent component. I used some pictures from Pexels to make the website more interesting. I have more complicated projects coming in the future, but I am putting up my projects as I get them done in order to display my skills. I won't explain the layout of the website as it should be intuitive and easy to use. The code was written by me without copying any tutorials. The design was done by me without using a template.
